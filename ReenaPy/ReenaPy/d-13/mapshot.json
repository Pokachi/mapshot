Upgraded, Aluminum Prospecting Begins<br/><strong>Location:</strong> Crash site<br/><strong>Coordinates:</strong> Y: 66.43, X: -80.00</p><h3>Summary:</h3><p>The iron crusher system has been expanded to four crushers, which now fully process an entire belt of iron ore. Throughput should improve dramatically from here. A small oversight in the ash routing belts caused coal production to jam briefly, but I caught and fixed it quickly.</p><p>Coal gas storage continues to balloon—I’ve expanded it again, but it’s clearly unsustainable. While searching for better uses beyond converting it to ash, I found a new tech: <strong>Fluid Mining</strong>. Turns out aluminum extraction uses coal gas. That’s far more useful than producing more ash, so I resumed research and completed it today.</p><p>Power demand finally exceeded what a single steam engine can handle, so I expanded the power setup. This should support the current infrastructure load for now.</p><p>Tomorrow, I plan to look into setting up fluid miners to extract aluminum. I don’t have an immediate need for aluminum yet, but it’s bound to be important. In the meantime, I also need to route the stone output from the iron crushers to a smelting array and continue scaling up the crushing system.</p><p>Still haven’t gotten to belt and inserter automation—too many critical tasks are piling up. I’ll need to finish these foundation upgrades before diving back into science.</p><h3>Immediate Actions:</h3><ul><li>Design and deploy fluid miners for aluminum extraction</li><li>Hook up crusher-generated stone to furnace array</li><li>Expand iron crushing as needed</li><li>Expand power infrastructure to support growing load</li><li>Begin belt and inserter automation planning</li></ul><h3>Personal Log:</h3><blockquote>“I keep underestimating how fast the base grows. Between coal gas overflow, power shortages, and iron crushing logistics, it’s nonstop work. At least the steel axe is saving me time. Aluminum might be the breakthrough I didn’t know I needed.”</blockquote></div>"
