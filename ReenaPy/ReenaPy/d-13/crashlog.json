    "I finalized wood production today and fully connected it to the rest of the base. With that in place, the last major blocker to closed-loop automation is finally gone.",
    "After stabilizing the factory, I spent time exploring the surrounding area. The northern region is dense with vegetation, while the south is largely covered in rock fields. During exploration, I discovered two separate Biter nests.",
    "The nests contain another type of hostile creature. These are heavily armored with large snapping mandibles. I’ll refer to them as Snappers. They appear significantly more dangerous than standard Biters.",
    "I also located two new iron ore patches, but there is still no sign of copper in the explored areas. Copper scarcity may become a serious issue if it isn’t found soon.",
    "Back at the base, I addressed several bottlenecks as I noticed them. Most of the issues trace back to insufficient power. To help alleviate this, I crafted a single fish turbine. It generates free energy, but it takes up a lot of real estate. Fortunately, I have plenty of open land to the north. The real limitation is fish—I only had enough to craft one turbine. It’s better than nothing, and I’m hoping to find more water during exploration.",
    "For now though, power constraints likely mean expanding boiler-based generation as well. The thought is worrying, since boilers are the largest contributors to ash production, but it may be unavoidable.",
    "Tomorrow I plan to do further optimization, expand power generation, and continue exploring the planet to better understand both resource distribution and local threats."
