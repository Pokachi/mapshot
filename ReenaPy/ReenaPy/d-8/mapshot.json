Online<br/><strong>Location:</strong> Crash site<br/><strong>Coordinates:</strong> Y: 59.85, X: 15.37</p><h3>Summary:</h3><p>I’ve finalized the blueprint for coke production and successfully brought the system online. Following that, I completed the steel processing blueprint as well. Steel turns out to be more complex than expected—it requires a heat source, and at the moment, the only available method is a burner running on wood. Since we don’t have a way to automate wood harvesting, I foresee a lot of manual trips to gather fuel in the near future.</p><p>I also spent most of the day collecting wood and stone from trees and surface rocks to keep things moving. On the research front, I unlocked Automation, though I haven’t had time to implement it yet. Right now, my focus remains on finalizing the infrastructure for carbolic oil and steel.</p><p>We're now generating byproducts—tar and coal gas—as part of the coke process. Tar will be used for carbolic oil, but for now, both are being stored. I came across a recipe that converts coal gas to ash, but I’m postponing that since I don’t want to introduce more ash into the system just yet.</p><p>Next up on the research queue is soil washing. This might open new opportunities for material extraction or cleanup.</p><h3>Immediate Actions:</h3><ul><li>Continue gathering wood to fuel the steel burner</li><li>Finalize infrastructure for carbolic oil processing</li><li>Store tar and coal gas until they can be processed</li><li>Begin research on soil washing</li></ul><h3>Personal Log:</h3><blockquote>\"Steel's not going to make itself. Turns out it’s not just about the recipe—it’s about the heat, the fuel, and the logistics. Wood is our bottleneck now, and that’s going to mean more long treks. But with coke and tar online, we’re a step closer to stone mining. One thing at a time.\"</blockquote></div>"}
