expansion<br/><strong>Location:</strong> Crash Site – Coordinates: Y: 54.45, X: -73.91</p><h3>Summary:</h3><p>Not much major progress today. I spent most of the time clearing a path through the forest toward the new iron patch. Unfortunately, I quickly realized we don’t have nearly enough iron to craft all the belts needed to reach it. With less than 500,000 units of iron ore left in the current patch, I’m hoping it will last long enough until I can hook up the new supply.</p><p>I also started reorganizing the furnaces into a dedicated smelting array. This frees up space to place more burner mining drills, which should help increase throughput and eventually make it easier to set up a proper dedicated iron belt.</p><p>Now that most of the drills and furnaces have automatic coal refueling, production is somewhat keeping up with demand. With a bit more self-sufficiency, I actually found myself with a little free time for the first time in a while. It’s a nice change of pace, even if it won’t last long.</p><h3>Immediate Actions:</h3><ul><li>Continue gathering enough iron to craft belts for the new iron patch connection.</li><li>Finish building the dedicated smelting array.</li><li>Expand burner drill operations to boost iron throughput.</li><li>Monitor remaining iron ore reserves closely.</li></ul><h3>Personal Log:</h3><blockquote>\"It feels strange having a little free time again. I’m grateful for the breather, but the pressure is still there. If the iron runs out before I secure the new patch, we’re in serious trouble. I can’t afford to get complacent.\"</blockquote></div>"}
