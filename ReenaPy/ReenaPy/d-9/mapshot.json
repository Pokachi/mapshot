Underway<br/><strong>Location:</strong> Crash site – Coordinates: <span class=\"coordinates\">Y: -123.49, X: -210.56</span></p><h3>Summary:</h3><p>Perimeter work continues—western wall is finally up, but I’m still bottlenecked by wood. Between bullets and fences, I’ll need a lot more trees before this base is fully secure. The steel pickaxe helps, but not enough yet.</p><p>The big infrastructure update today was carbolic oil production. It’s... functional. Tar gets converted into coal gas and carbolic oil, which now lets me produce stone, though at a fairly underwhelming rate. We've also set up a system to automatically convert excess coal gas into ash once the holding tank nears capacity. It doesn’t solve our ash problem, but it ensures steel production won't stall due to a backup in coal gas. Continuous operation matters more right now than perfect efficiency.</p><p>The crusher is now operational, and it’s a game-changer. It’s giving us better iron efficiency and a consistent secondary stream of stone. At least for the foreseeable future, crushed iron is now our primary source of stone, while traditional stone mining will play a supporting role.</p><p>Iron plate production took a hit—I had to pause output to reconfigure the smelters for the improved recipe via the crusher. It’ll take a bit of time to get the plates flowing again, but it’s a worthwhile trade-off for long-term gains.</p><p>Also did a bit of beltwork—rerouted one of the coal lines to streamline input. Minor optimization, but it helps.</p><p>Science remains paused. No point researching further until I digest and implement the recipes we've already unlocked.</p><h3>Immediate Actions:</h3><ul><li>Restore iron plate production now that crusher is live</li><li>Hook up mined stone to join with crusher stone output</li><li>Gather more wood to finish perimeter and craft bullets</li><li>Resume science once infrastructure stabilizes</li></ul><h3>Nova’s Analysis:</h3><blockquote>\"Iron processing: upgraded. Stone yield improved via crushing. Carbolic oil processing active, though stone output remains low. Automatic overflow-to-ash system deployed for coal gas to prevent production stalls. Iron plate reserves critical—production resumption recommended. Wood remains a limiting factor in base defense. Science halted: awaiting resource stabilization.\"</blockquote><h3>Personal Log:</h3><blockquote>\"The crusher’s a beast—messy to set up, but worth every second. Stone’s trickling in steadily now. Not enough to forget about mining, but it buys breathing room. Carbolic oil, on the other hand, is a mixed bag. Useful, sure, but I expected more. At least coal gas won’t back everything up now that we’re turning overflow into ash. I’ve got walls half-finished and bullets half-loaded. Still feels like I’m always halfway to everything.\"</blockquote></div>"}
