Unlocked<br/><strong>Location:</strong> Crash site<br/><strong>Coordinates:</strong> Y: 17.16, X: -37.03</p><h3>Summary:</h3><p>Today involved more treks to gather wood and stone—resources we’re still critically dependent on. I discovered an issue in the steel production blueprint: the burner and foundry weren’t aligned correctly, and since we don’t have heat pipes yet, they must be placed adjacent. After redesigning the setup, I finally brought steel production online. It’s a demanding process, requiring both wood for heat and raw iron ore, so I also had to expand the iron mining operation to keep up.</p><p>The ash storage system also reached near-capacity again, prompting another expansion to prevent overflow and disruption. As for carbolic oil, everything is ready except for the coal input. Once that’s in place, I expect we’ll be able to automate stone mining as early as tomorrow.</p><p>On the research front, I completed both <strong>Soil Washing</strong> and <strong>Crusher</strong> today. While Soil Washing doesn’t offer immediate utility, Crusher is a major step forward. It lets us preprocess iron ore before smelting, improving efficiency and producing stone as a byproduct—something we desperately need. The yield improves from 12:1 to approximately 9.33:1. It may not sound dramatic, but at our current scale, every gain counts.</p><p>Given all these changes, I’m going to temporarily pause science until we can start consuming the new recipes unlocked by recent research—including stone mining, iron crushing, and automated assembly for belts and inserters.</p><h3>Immediate Actions:</h3><ul><li>Finalize coal input for carbolic oil processing</li><li>Begin automated stone mining</li><li>Redesign and implement crusher-based iron preprocessing</li><li>Continue expanding ash storage as needed</li></ul><h3>Personal Log:</h3><blockquote>\"It’s frustrating to rebuild something because of a small design flaw, but that’s the reality of survival engineering. The payoff is worth it, though—steel is finally flowing, and crusher tech opens up a whole new path for efficiency. Tomorrow, we mine stone without picking up a single rock by hand. That’s a milestone I’ve been working toward for days. With so many systems in flux, I’m putting science on hold—let’s actually use what we just unlocked first.\"</blockquote></div>"}
