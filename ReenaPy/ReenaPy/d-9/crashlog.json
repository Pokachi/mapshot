    "Today was mostly focused on refactoring the base to be more space-efficient while connecting systems to achieve full automation. I began relocating major components to make room for a cleaner, more scalable layout.",
    "So far, I’ve moved the mall and the solid separators and fully connected their inputs, achieving end-to-end automation for those systems. Iron ash outputs are now routed directly into the solid separator. Copper ash and steam integration are still pending.",
    "There is still a significant amount of work ahead. Power generation, coal processing, and steel production all need to be rebuilt to fit the new layout and support higher throughput.",
    "To support the upcoming power redesign, I researched one more additional chunk to unlock more space around the water source. This additional space should allow for a much larger and more stable power generation setup going forward."
