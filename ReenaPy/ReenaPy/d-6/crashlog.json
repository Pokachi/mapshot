    "Somewhat of a slow day today. Didn't get too many stuff done, but hey it happens."
    "I redesigned iron processing to use the crusher. The new setup is much more efficient—5 iron ore per plate instead of 8—but the power requirements and size of the crusher mean I can only keep a few running. The majority of smelting is still done by direct insertion for now.",
    "While analyzing steel production, I noticed the real bottleneck is limestone, which itself is limited by water purification. To address this, I redesigned the water purification setup, increasing capacity fourfold to support higher steel output.",
    "I also researched glasswork, which is needed for advanced production. However, it requires quartz, and I currently don’t have access to any chunks containing quartz. To prepare, I researched one additional chunk, though it still isn’t enough to reach quartz deposits. Future expansion will need to focus on locating and claiming quartz-rich chunks."
