  "time": "Noon",
  "summary": [
    "I pushed the borders outward today. Not because I needed more land, but because a massive ancient remain was sitting right on the edge of my perimeter, blocking proper turret placement. It was bothering me more than it should have. If I want a clean defensive line, I can’t have dead structures dictating my layout. So expansion it was.",
    "The new perimeter is… established. Technically. Iron shortages forced me to space the turrets and wooden fences farther apart than I’m comfortable with. There’s no ammo automation yet — no belts, no inserters feeding the guns. Just manual refills and hope. It’s a skeleton of a defense. It works, but only barely.",
    "Daytime attacks don’t worry me much anymore. Regular biters and spitters feel manageable now. Night, though, is still tense. Nuclear biters and those wasp spitters hit hard and fast. They rip through sections of the line quicker than I can rebuild them, and every repair costs iron I don’t really have to spare.",
    "Inside the new borders, I cleared out all the trees and rocks. The wood stockpile looks decent again, but stone is still painfully low. It’s starting to feel like stone is quietly controlling everything — science, production, expansion. I mine it, and it disappears just as quickly.",
    "I relocated the fuel processor further north to simplify the ash routing. One less awkward belt running across the base feels good. But more importantly, it saves iron. I also pulled the copper furnaces closer to the iron smelting array. The layout is slowly becoming tighter, more deliberate.",
    "I started building a basic logistics mall today. The ratios are completely wrong — I didn’t even try to calculate them. At this stage, convenience matters more than elegance. I just want the base to supply itself without constant handcrafting.",
    "Iron is the real problem now. The starter patch is fully saturated, and demand keeps climbing. Every improvement I want to make costs iron plates. I may have to begin mining the newly claimed southern deposit soon if I want growth to continue.",
    "Research-wise, I finished Coal Processing. Next step will be coke and carbolic oil production. If coke improves fuel efficiency and carbolic oil helps with sustainable stone mining, it could ease two pressures at once — ash overflow and stone scarcity. That’s the hope, at least.",
	"For now, everything feels like it’s waiting on iron."
