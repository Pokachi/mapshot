Generation<br/><strong>Location:</strong> Outpost Aegis – Coordinates: Y: 45.31, X: -26.31</p><h3>Summary:</h3><p>I wrapped up the expansion of the iron furnace array today, now consisting of three full columns. The iron ore in our initial patch is starting to dwindle—only about 360,000 units left.</p><p>I also laid out the ghost schematics for the new iron patch to the west but decided to hold off on constructing it for now. After some consideration, it seems wise to pursue research before fully committing. Our current iron plate recipe is incredibly inefficient, costing a staggering 16 iron ore per plate. It’s clear we need better processing methods if we want to stay sustainable.</p><p>To start researching, I’ll need electricity. So, I began designing a boiler and steam engine setup to generate power.</p><p>Tomorrow’s goal will be to bring basic science production online and investigate better iron processing methods before expanding westward.</p><h3>Immediate Actions:</h3><ul><li>Complete the boiler and steam engine setup to generate electricity.</li><li>Begin basic science production.</li><li>Research improved iron processing methods.</li><li>Delay construction of the western iron patch until a better iron recipe is secured.</li></ul><h3>Personal Log:</h3><blockquote>“It feels a little strange holding off expansion when resources are running low, but charging ahead blindly could cost more in the long run. If there’s even a chance of a better iron recipe, it’s worth taking a short detour.”</blockquote></div>"}
