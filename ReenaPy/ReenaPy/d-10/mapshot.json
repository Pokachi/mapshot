Mining Online<br/><strong>Location:</strong> Crash site<br/><strong>Coordinates:</strong> Y: -18.20, X: 28.28</p><h3>Summary:</h3><p>Carbolic oil production is finally online. Throughput is quite slow, and the process generates more coal gas than expected. I had to expand coal gas storage again just to keep pace, and even with that, it's filling rapidly. For now, I’ll keep scaling storage and hope the project finishes before we run out of space entirely.</p><p>With carbolic oil, I was able to bring a single stone miner online. It’s not much—throughput is very limited—but it’s a start. On the bright side, the miner also produces kerogen as a byproduct, which works well as a fuel. That means I don’t have to run a separate coal belt out to the stone miner. Still, stone output is poor at the moment, so I’m hoping the crushers I’m setting up will help generate more stone while processing iron ore.</p><p>To support the carbolic oil process, I expanded coal production again. I also finally crafted enough steel to unlock the steel axe, which dramatically boosts my manual gathering speed—good news, since I still need large amounts of wood.</p><p>I created a blueprint to start processing iron with crushers. Unfortunately, crushers are resource-heavy, so I’m holding off on deployment until I’ve stockpiled enough iron plates. Once ready, I’ll dismantle the current iron array and replace it with the crusher setup.</p><p>Next on the agenda is expanding ash routing for both coal and steam power, now that the layout of the base is starting to solidify.</p><h3>Immediate Actions:</h3><ul><li>Continue scaling coal gas storage</li><li>Expand stone production via crusher integration</li><li>Replace existing iron smelting array with new crusher system</li><li>Implement ash routing for coal and power</li></ul><h3>Personal Log:</h3><blockquote>\"Carbolic oil changed everything—but just barely. One stone miner is a joke, and the real solution might come from a completely different process. The crusher could be our hidden ace here, both for better metal yield and that desperately needed stone. We’re inching forward, but it’s still a grind. At least the steel axe makes it less painful.\"</blockquote></div>"}
