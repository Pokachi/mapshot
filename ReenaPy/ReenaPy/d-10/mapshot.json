complete, systems stabilizing<br/><strong>Location:</strong> Crash site – Coordinates: <span class=\"coordinates\">Y: -41.37, X: 57.95</span></p><h3>Summary:</h3><p>Progress today was strong—our northern perimeter is finally in place. With just one section remaining, I expect the full perimeter to be finished by tomorrow. Once it’s done, the base will feel significantly more secure.</p><p>We’ve also connected our stone mining operation into the crusher’s stone line, streamlining our stone intake. The byproduct kerogen is now being stockpiled for future use. It’s slightly more energy-efficient than raw coal, but limited production means it won’t replace our main fuel just yet. Still, it’s worth keeping as a supplementary source when needed.</p><p>Stone miner ash is now routed into our central ash system. Speaking of ash—we’ve expanded storage again, but we’re clearly hitting a limit. We’ll need a more permanent solution soon. That might be our next research goal once we resume science.</p><p>Iron plate production is back online after the crusher integration. It’s a relief to have steady output again.</p><h3>Immediate Actions:</h3><ul><li>Complete the final stretch of perimeter fencing and turrets</li><li>Monitor kerogen levels for potential use as backup fuel</li><li>Plan long-term solution for ash processing and disposal</li><li>Prepare for restarting science operations</li></ul><h3>Nova’s Analysis:</h3><blockquote>\"Perimeter coverage at ~85%—completion expected within next cycle. Stone miner integration successful. Ash routing fully operational for both crushed and mined stone. Kerogen output noted; stored for future auxiliary fuel use. Iron plate production has stabilized. Ash containment nearing capacity—recommend researching advanced waste management.\"</blockquote><h3>Personal Log:</h3><blockquote>\"We’re close—just one more push and the entire base will be walled off and armed. Feels good. Having the stone mine hooked into the crusher’s output cleaned things up nicely, and it’s one less thing to manage. Kerogen’s interesting, not game-changing, but it’ll help stretch our coal when needed. Iron plates flowing again too. Feels like we’re finally getting ahead.\"</blockquote></div>"}
