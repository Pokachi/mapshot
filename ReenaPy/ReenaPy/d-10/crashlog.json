    "Base automation is still the primary focus. I built one additional solid separator to help process the growing ash backlog. It’s not a complete solution yet, but ash is no longer overwhelming the system as quickly as before.",
    "Automation science production is now fully automated. The ratios aren’t perfect, but science is flowing steadily through a streamlined production chain instead of being assembled by hand.",
    "I redesigned and rebuilt the boiler and steam engine setup to support the expanding factory. The new layout should be easier to scale and maintain once everything is fully online.",
    "Coal processing is nearly complete after a major redesign. Once finished, it should integrate more cleanly with power generation, steel production, and byproduct handling.",
    "There was little actual science progression today. I spent nearly half the day without power during the rebuild, but once the new systems are fully operational, managing the base should be significantly easier and more reliable."
