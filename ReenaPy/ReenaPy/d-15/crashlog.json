    "I explored the western side of the base today. As expected, Biter nest clusters become more common the farther I move away from the crash site. For now, they remain at a safe distance, but it’s clear that expansion will eventually bring me closer to sustained hostilities.",
    "I made a few minor optimizations to stabilize science production a bit further. Output is slightly higher and more consistent, but it’s becoming obvious that optimization alone won’t be enough to drive meaningful progress anymore. Scaling production is the only real path forward.",
    "I cleared a large amount of forest and rock around the base to prepare for future expansion, though I haven’t fully committed to where that expansion should take place yet.",
    "At this point, I’ve accumulated thirteen chunk expansion points. Claiming new territory has become a strategic decision rather than a routine one. Each new claim becomes more expensive if it borders existing territory, so I need to plan expansion carefully to conserve points and maximize usable space.",
    "I’m starting to sketch out a more deliberate expansion pattern—one that allows growth in multiple directions without excessive overlap. At the same time, science production will need a major redesign to support future research costs.",
    "This planning phase may take some time. Until I settle on a solid expansion and redesign strategy, progress will be slow, and there may be no significant updates for a while."
