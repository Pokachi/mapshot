    "I explored the eastern side of the base today. Biter nests appear to become more common the farther out I go. In one area, I spotted three separate clusters within close proximity, suggesting enemy density increases rapidly with distance from the crash site.",
    "Between exploration runs, I made several small optimizations to the base. Science production has stabilized at roughly five units per minute. While steady, progress feels slow as research costs continue to climb.",
    "The next additional chunk upgrade now requires a massive amount of science compared to earlier expansions. At the current production rate, claiming more territory will take a long time, making expansion a much more deliberate decision.",
    "I also expanded the boiler setup to increase power output. Interestingly, running the base at full power allowed the solid separators to operate faster, and they are now processing ash more quickly than it is being produced. For the first time, ash is no longer a limiting factor.",
    "I identified a technology that is particularly tempting: nanobots. The research cost is enormous, far beyond anything I can currently support. At my present pace, unlocking it would take an impractically long time, but the potential benefits are hard to ignore.",
    "There is still no sign of additional water sources in the explored regions. Next time, I plan to head west and hope for better luck."
