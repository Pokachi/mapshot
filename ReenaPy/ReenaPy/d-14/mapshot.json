and wood automation<br/><strong>Location:</strong> Outpost Aegis – Coordinates: <span class=\"coordinates\">Y: -56.81, X: 96.99</span></p><h3>Summary:</h3><p>Today was all about scaling. Copper demand spiked again, so I expanded our copper smelting operations to keep up. Steam power and coal production also received upgrades to support the growing energy requirements across the base.</p><p>The big milestone: we’ve finally closed the loop on automated wood production. Only a fraction of the planned infrastructure is online—2 of 22 Fastwood Forestries, 7 of 36 Moss Farms, and 5 of 10 Botanical Nurseries—but the framework is in place. From here, it’s just a matter of expansion.</p><p>Ash storage has also been scaled up again. We’re still not processing it, but at least we’re not drowning in it… yet.</p><p>Interestingly, wood turns out to be a better fuel than raw coal—2MJ versus 1.5MJ, and it produces no ash. That’s one less byproduct to manage, which is tempting. But the production time is a bottleneck. With how long it takes to generate a meaningful amount of wood, I don’t think it makes sense to switch entirely. Besides, we still need ash to grow more trees and continue science.</p><h3>Immediate Actions:</h3><ul><li>Continue expanding Fastwood, Moss, and Nursery systems</li><li>Monitor copper, power, and coal as wood production ramps</li><li>Evaluate future use of wood as a supplementary fuel</li><li>Resume science once infrastructure catches up</li></ul><h3>Nova’s Analysis:</h3><blockquote>\"Wood automation loop established. Current output suboptimal: expansion required. Copper throughput improved; energy and fuel production scaled to match demand. Ash storage expanded. Wood identified as superior combustion fuel—limited by generation rate. Ash remains essential to tree growth and science chain.\"</blockquote><h3>Personal Log:</h3><blockquote>\"Watching the first logs roll off the line felt surreal—like seeing the first flame after inventing fire. But we’ve only scratched the surface. I can feel the machine waking up, piece by piece. It's going to get loud.\"</blockquote></div>"}
