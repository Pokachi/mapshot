    "Today was mostly focused on automation and scaling. Overall, I managed to triple all basic resource extraction, which should accelerate construction and expansion significantly.",
    "I designed a furnace array for both iron and copper and started belting resources from the mining drills to a dedicated smelting array. Four drills can satisfy the needs of five furnaces, so routing outputs via belts to multiple furnaces improves throughput compared to direct insertion. Space constraints mean some iron drills still output directly to furnaces, but this setup maximizes efficiency where possible.",
    "Research has become a critical bottleneck. Without unlocking additional chunks, expansion is limited. Initiating research will be my top priority once the smelting and mining systems stabilize.",
    "I also strengthened defenses by crafting more turrets, extending wooden fences, and preparing additional bullets. As expected, Biters attacked during the night again, testing the perimeter. The new turrets and fences held strong, and no drills were lost.",
    "By dawn, the site was secure, and I could focus on blueprinting further expansions and planning more advanced automation, preparing the groundwork for sustainable scaling."
