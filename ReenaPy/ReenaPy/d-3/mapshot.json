basic material extraction and furnace setup<br/><strong>Location:</strong> Crash site – Coordinates: <span class=\"coordinates\">Y: 44.33, X: -11.91</span></p><h3>Summary:</h3><p>We’ve managed to set up a basic furnace array for copper processing, leaving room for future expansion. However, we are still drastically short on raw materials needed to manufacture essential components like inserters and belts. These are critical for automating our smelting operations, and without them, progress is painfully slow. The copper mining drill we placed earlier ran dry this morning, meaning we need to deploy new ones. Copper extraction is at a standstill until we can place additional drills in new locations. As for the ongoing ash issue, we’ve constructed a temporary ash storage solution using wooden boxes. These boxes don’t have much capacity, but they give us a temporary solution to store the ash until we come up with a better system. The ashes still need to be routed to this new storage location, but again, we’re short on materials to build the necessary infrastructure to automate this. Only the iron smelting furnace array is currently hooked up and functional. We are continuing to ramp up iron production, but even with increased output, we’re still not meeting the growing demand. The furnaces are running at full capacity, but there’s simply not enough raw material coming in to keep up with the needs of the base.</p><h3>Immediate Actions:</h3><ul><li>Continue scaling up iron and copper production</li><li>Deploy new copper mining drills to resume copper extraction</li><li>Automate ash removal and routing to storage location once materials are available</li><li>Manually clear ash buildup from furnaces and drills to prevent shutdown</li><li>Build more temporary storage for additional raw materials and ash</li></ul><h3>Nova’s Analysis:</h3><blockquote>\"Current production rate insufficient to meet demand. Copper extraction halted due to dry mining drill. Raw material extraction efficiency must be improved. Ash routing to storage location pending due to limited materials. Recommend prioritizing infrastructure for ash management and automating processes for material extraction.\"</blockquote><h3>Personal Log:</h3><blockquote>\"More furnaces, more machines, more ash. It’s all coming together, but it feels like we’re stuck in a loop. It’s only a matter of time before the ash piles up and chokes everything again. We’ll figure it out eventually. At least the copper’s starting to look like it’s going somewhere... if we can get more. Meanwhile, I’ll need to keep the ash cleared to prevent a system shutdown. Time to dig in and keep moving forward.\"</blockquote></div>"}
