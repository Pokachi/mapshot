  "summary": [
    "I redesigned the base defenses today. The layout makes more sense now — tighter angles, better turret overlap, fewer blind spots. On paper, it’s solid. In reality, it requires far more resources than I currently have. I’m especially short on wood. Something as simple as fencing has become a bottleneck.",
    "Iron and copper mines are now hooked up directly to coal lines. They’re partially automated, and for the first time the machines can run for extended periods without me hovering nearby. They still clog with ash and require manual clearing, but at least they don’t starve immediately. It’s progress — imperfect, but real.",
    "The base can handle standard biters and spitters reasonably well now. Daytime attacks are manageable. Night is another matter. The larger variants — stronger biters and more aggressive spitters — still punch holes in the perimeter if I’m not careful. I can feel the margin for error shrinking.",
    "Science has introduced a new complication. The research requires native flora samples, which meant expanding the base again to claim territory containing the necessary flowers. I stretched the perimeter just enough to secure them.",
    "That expansion cost me nearly everything. I only have enough claim authority left for one more chunk. After that, I’m boxed in until research restores the system. That means science needs to be operational within the next couple of days. No delays."
