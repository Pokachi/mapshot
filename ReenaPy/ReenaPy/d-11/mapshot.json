Expansion<br/><strong>Location:</strong> Crash Site – Coordinates: Y: 61.87, X: -54.98</p><h3>Summary:</h3><p>I completed the boiler and steam engine setup today, bringing electricity online. A soil extractor was installed to start producing soil from water, one of the key ingredients needed for automation science packs.</p><p>However, I vastly underestimated the materials required to proceed. The floral collector alone demands over 1,300 copper plates and 2,200 iron plates—an overwhelming amount for our current capabilities. Worse yet, even if we discovered better iron processing tech, we’d still need to build new machines to utilize it, which would demand even more resources.</p><p>Given these new realities, I’ve decided to postpone research efforts. Instead, we're shifting focus back to securing our next iron patch. With only 300,000 iron ore remaining in our initial field and an estimated 800 belts needed to connect the new patch, immediate action is necessary. It’s time to stockpile belts and get that western iron mine operational as soon as possible.</p><h3>Immediate Actions:</h3><ul><li>Prioritize amassing materials for belts to connect the new iron patch.</li><li>Postpone science research until iron supply is secured.</li><li>Continue monitoring existing iron ore reserves closely.</li></ul><h3>Personal Log:</h3><blockquote>“Plans change. Flexibility is key to survival. Research can wait—without iron, we won't survive long enough to use any of it.”</blockquote></div>"}
