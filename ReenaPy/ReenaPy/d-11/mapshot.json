research resumed<br/><strong>Location:</strong> Outpost Aegis – Coordinates: <span class=\"coordinates\">Y: 38.78, X: -64.87</span></p><h3>Summary:</h3><p>The perimeter is finally complete—every fence post and turret is in place, and each turret is stocked with 10 rounds of wooden ammo. It's not perfect, but it marks a major milestone. With this foundation secured, I’m officially naming the base: <strong>Outpost Aegis</strong>. It’s our first true shelter since the crash, and it’s starting to feel like a proper foothold.</p><p>Science has resumed after our extended pause. We’ve researched <strong>Ash Separation</strong>, <strong>Mining with Fluid</strong>, and <strong>Glass Technologies</strong>. While ash management is a looming problem, I’ve decided to hold off on processing it for now. Ash will actually play a crucial role in automating science later, so hoarding it a little longer may pay off.</p><p>With <strong>Mining with Fluid</strong>, we now have a use for coal gas—mining aluminum. It's still an early implementation, but I've set up a temporary fluid miner to convert some of our coal gas into aluminum plates. It’s a better use of excess gas than converting it straight into ash.</p><p><strong>Glass technologies appear to be a required stepping stone toward tree farming, which is now our top priority.</strong><br/>We still can’t automate wood or ammo resupply yet, so for now, we’ll have to stick with manual runs and hope the defenses hold.</p><h3>Immediate Actions:</h3><ul><li>Begin research into tree farming via the glass tech branch</li><li>Stockpile ash for future science automation rather than process it</li><li>Evaluate long-term use of aluminum and whether more fluid miners are warranted</li><li>Plan early designs for automated ammo resupply infrastructure</li></ul><h3>Nova’s Analysis:</h3><blockquote>\"Perimeter fully secured. All turrets online and ammunition supplied. Base designation confirmed: Outpost Aegis. Science operations restored. Glass research unlocks potential path toward renewable wood. Aluminum extraction functional—temporary setup adequate for initial stockpile. Recommend deferring ash separation until downstream science demand is met.\"</blockquote><h3>Personal Log:</h3><blockquote>\"It’s done. The fences, the turrets, the ammo. Outpost Aegis is holding steady. Restarting science feels like flipping a switch in my brain—I’ve missed this kind of momentum. There’s still a lot to do, but this place? It finally feels like it might last.\"</blockquote></div>"}
