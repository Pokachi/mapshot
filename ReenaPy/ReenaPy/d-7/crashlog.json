    "I researched one more additional chunk and claimed the four chunks to the right of the native flowers, moving towards the quartz deposits. I believe one more chunk research should finally give access to quartz.",
    "I cleared all the forests and stone in the newly unlocked chunks to improve logistical space and make room for future construction and expansions.",
    "Despite the solid separator being online, we are still producing more ash than we consume. It’s clear that additional solid separators will be needed to handle the surplus.",
    "I expanded the crusher by one more unit to increase iron processing throughput, though space and power constraints still limit the number of crushers I can run simultaneously.",
    "Most of the rest of the day was spent running around keeping operations running. It’s becoming clear that the base needs a redesign soon to make it more automated, efficient, and scalable."
