    "Impact velocity was lower than terminal—barely.",
    "The ship broke apart on entry, scattering essential systems across the surface. Most equipment was destroyed or lost on impact. Salvageable assets are minimal: one mining drill and one offshore water pump recovered.",
    "There is some good news. The atmosphere is breathable, and no signs of active civilization have been detected. More importantly, the planet is rich beyond projection. Dense deposits of minerals, including numerous unknown mineral types, are scattered across the surface. Forests and stone fields are extensive.",
    "Unfortunately, that is where the good news ends. Only one small lake has been detected, and its water is unsuitable for most machines without purification. Automated construction is restricted by an active territorial claim protocol. Only a few nearby chunks can be claimed using emergency authority. Expanding beyond this limit will require additional research to reconstruct the claim system."
