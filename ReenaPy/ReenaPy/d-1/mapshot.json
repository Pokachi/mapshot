resources<br/><strong>Location:</strong> Crash site – Coordinates: Y: -52.12, X: -145.08</p><h3>Summary:</h3><p>Today was mostly about laying out the groundwork for our resource extraction efforts. I created blueprints for iron, copper, and coal, ensuring there’s an 8-tile-wide lane for logistics in the future. It quickly became apparent that the material costs are steep, and mass production is still a distant goal.</p><p>The nights here are pitch black, and without a light source, it’s almost impossible to see anything. This made mining iron ore the only feasible task during the night. I spent the entire night mining iron, which should help speed up production in the coming days. During the day, I focused on creating blueprints and ghost entities for future resource extraction, while also exploring the surrounding area.</p><p>I also discovered that copper mining requires water, which posed a challenge. Fortunately, we got lucky. We managed to salvage an offshore pump and a burner mining drill from the wreckage, both of which are essential for copper mining. These were items I wouldn’t have been able to make otherwise, as they require copper to craft.</p><p>With enough iron mined, I was able to set up a water pipe from a nearby lake to facilitate copper mining. I also crafted enough iron plates to begin researching steam power and enough copper plates to research automation science packs. However, we still have a long way to go. Gathering basic resources is still slow, and we need to ramp up production before we can move forward.</p><h3>Immediate Actions:</h3><ul><li>Continue gathering basic resources like iron, copper, and coal</li><li>Increase mining capacity to speed up resource collection</li></ul><h3>Personal Log:</h3><blockquote>\"Progress is slow, but we’re getting there. The pitch-black nights are tough, but we’ve salvaged enough equipment to keep going. I’m cautiously optimistic, though I know there’s still much to be done. Every step forward feels like a small victory on this harsh planet.\"</blockquote></div>"}
